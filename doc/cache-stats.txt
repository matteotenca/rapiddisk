device: RapidDisk-Cache device name.

reads: Number of total reads to the RapidDisk-Cache front-node device. That means total reads that will hit both the cache and backing store devices.

writes: Number of total writes to the RapidDisk-Cache front-node device. That means total writes that will hit both the cache and backing store devices.

cache_hits: Number of read/write operations that hit the cache device.

replacement: Follows a cache miss, where blocks are replaced into the cache device.

write_replacement: Writes replaced out of the cache. Will be "0" in WA mode.

read_invalidates: Invalidated overlapping read cache blocks.

write_invalidates: Invalidated overlapping write cache blocks.

uncached_reads: Backing store reads that were not cached.

uncached_writes: Backing store writes that were not cached.

disk_reads: Reads from the backing store device.

disk_writes: Writes to the backing store device.

cache_reads: Reads from the cache device.

cache_writes: Writes to the cache device.
